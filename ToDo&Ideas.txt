To Do List before considering it in alpha:

- NPC's + Diolauge
- Stats + Leveling
- World Design
- New Bullet Patterns
- A few music tracks?
- More frames of anim.
- Tabs in Inventory
- Mortal Embers System(see below)
- Right Click Melee Abilities 
- More Enemies + Items (duh)
- Passive Healing & Status Effects(?)
- Fix depth of feild issues
- Title Screen + basic menus
- basic cutscenes 
- Knockback on enemies (white flash too)


Big Ideas:

Mortal Embers System:
  - Burning mortal embers alows you to move between a few different versions of the world with different missions
  and enemies in each.
  - Different graphics/versions of each area (like maybe past-present-future)
  
Range Effects Damage:
  - The closer you are the more damage your bullets do?
  
Armor that Falls off:
  - Enemies have armor peices that like take on hit and fall off before they can be damaged.
